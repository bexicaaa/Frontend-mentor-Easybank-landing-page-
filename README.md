# 100 Days of Code - Day 01 - Frontend-mentor-project-Easybank-landing-page

This was a follow along project with Coder Coder tutorial on Youtube.

It was a little bit of a refresher on HTML and CSS, since I had a quite of a break with these. Along the way I also learned a couple of new things, mostly about animations
and using helper classes to make code reusable.
